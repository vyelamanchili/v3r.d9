Today I woke up at 11:00 am. We had plans of going out to dammam again today. I surfed the net searched for some answers to my questions and then had lunch.<p>

Then I heard to radio (unlike Indian radio Here are many Radio channels for English songs) as timepass and then I went to Dad's Office for some understanding of what work he does and what work does his assitant do on Computer, To get some idea on what kinda programming Igot to do in future.<p>

Then I and Dad went to Dossary towers for some work and then returned home from office together at 6:30 pm. We thought we will go out but as the Drivers were busy we couldnt go outing. So we stayed home and saw Tv and then slept at 12:00 am.
