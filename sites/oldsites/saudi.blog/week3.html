<h5><a name="#day14">Day 14</a></h5><br><br><u>Date:- 31th May 2004</u>,<p>
<font size=4>
Today, on my first day of the 3rd week here, I Woke up at 11:30 am and waited for evening to come as today we were going to PC-NET. I updated my site and then after eating lunch played my games on PS2 till 5 pm.<p>

In the evening Dad came and informed us that there was again shooting in Dammam, so again we cancelled our outing. So we ate Aloo paratha for dinner and then saw "Lion King 1 1/2" on DVD and later we saw tv and then slept.<p>

The violence here in Khobar is getting more and more serious. The killing here has increased so much making us not able to go out. Yesterday 22 people were killed among whom 50% were asians. The terrorists are asking if they are muslims and then killing only non-muslims. See the news for more information.<p>

<h5><a name="#day15">Day 15</a></h5><br><br><u>Date:- 1th June 2004</u>,<p>
<font size=4>
Today I Woke up at 11:00 am and after the regular work I played my game "sphinx and the cursed mummy" till 6 pm.<p>

Then after shutting down the Ps2 my dad came and then we ate dinner. After we ate dinner we got ready to go out after 3 days.  We went to Alisa Souk and exchanged the DVD ( Home on the range,Lion king 1 1/2 and finding nemo ) for another DVD with movies ,Matrix Revolutions,The rundown,Master and commander and the missing, for free . <p>

After exchanging the DVD we went to PC-NET, after a Many days of waiting. We dropped mom at Clothes shop and we moved on to our computer shops. We were looking for "GeForce 4 Ti 4200/4800" for many days but couldn't find it without the extra feature of TV Capture card. The one we found till today was GeForce 4 Ti 4400 with TV-in and was priced at 600 riyals. <p>

Today we found The exact card we wanted with tv-in for 330 riyals only and also found the usual Radeon 9200 Se for 220 riyals. We thought we will do a little more surveying before buying coz we found what we wanted in the first shop itself. When we completed our survey and thought of taking from the first shop we found the shop closed and couldnt take it. It was 10:00 pm So all the shops were closing.<p>

we saw some cell phone models. There was a 3310 nokia model for second hand priced at 150 riyals. It was very neat and good  looking for a second hand model.<p>

We then went back to the clothes shop and looked at the choices of mom for dad and bought them. As it was Dad's Birthday on 3rd mom wanted to buy new clothes for Dad. <p>

After we returned home we saw "Darkman" the movie on TV and slept at 11:30 pm.

<h5><a name="#day16">Day 16</a></h5><br><br><u>Date:- 2th June 2004</u>,<p>
<font size=4>
Today I Woke up at 10:45 am . Today I felt like the days are suddenly passing very fast. I updated my site, ate lunch with with everyone and and then ate my TUB ICECREAM (ICECREAM IN A TUB), which we bought for 7.5 riyals in an offer. Then I continued my gameplay of "Sphinx" till 4 pm.<p>

Today I stopped playing at 4 pm itself coz I, My mom and me were going out to PC-NET area again coz my mom wanted to exchange  some clothes she bought the other day for Dad's Birthday. And then we ( Me and my bro went to buy the graphic card we saw last night for 350 riyals (NVidia Geforce4 Ti 4200 with Tv Capture facilty). we saw in some more shops for that card for cheaper price. But none had that card (As it was mentioned in the sites that it is rare to find those cards). So we returned to that shop in the last and as we couldnt bargain with that person we took it for 350 riyals.<p>

So finally we bought the graphic card which we all the time wanted. We got a great and rare card for so less price. Then we went back to mom and shopped some more.<p>

Then we returned home and saw TV. When Dad returned in the evening from office. Mom told us all that PURUSHOTTAM uncle and his family was coming to our house right now.<p>

When they arrived we were watching "Big Momma's house" on "Channel 2" . Then my brother after some time of sitting and talking went and brought some KUPPUS for dinner. I played for the whole time with their little son ,Very cute, Pavan. Uncle saw the Music system and the reciever and was praising us for such a good choice. He was impressed by the output in Dolby Digital. <p>

Then we ate Dinner and later went out into the garden inside the compound itself. Pavan enjoyed a lot in the park with us. I and my brother played Basket ball and enjoyed a lot in the night till they left.<p>

After they left we went in and found the time to be 10:15 pm . so we saw for any movies on TV and found the movie "INDEPENDENCE DAY" coming on "channel 2" . As we saw the movie 3 times already we decided to see "The Rundown", starring WWE's Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, from the DVD we bought recently at ALISSA Souk.<p>

The movie was very nice with good amount of comedy. We enjoyed the movie with Coke tins and ice cream. After the movie , I wished my dad "Happy Birthday" as on 3rd was his birthday and then we slept.
