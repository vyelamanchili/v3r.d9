<h5><a name="#day21">Day 21</a></h5><br><br><u>Date:- 7th June 2004</u>,<p>
<font size=4>
Today I Woke up at 11:30 am. I used the laptop till 1:00 pm and then we ate lunch and then I played PS2. The optic cable was still not working so we couldnt enjoy the 5.1 surround sound during gameplay. When We told Dad about it he said he will get it replaced. I never thought they will take the cable back.<p>

I played till 6:30 pm. Reetu went to dads office and used the internet there to download some game trailers and bring it home. He brought JAK 3 game trailer . The connection in the office was 64kbps line. Near Giant store I saw a 256 kbps leased line cybercafe and its price per hour was 3 riyals only. <p> 

At 6:30 pm we left for Gulf tower for computer shops by Taxi and then as we didnt find any good CDs and digital camera we walked to another big mall and took samosa and pakodi for eating for time pass during prayer time. I looked for Nokia 2100 covers but couldnt find any good ones. I saw some digital cameras also but all were very costly ( starting at 899 riyals).<p>

After prayer time we looked in more shops. I saw the demonstration of sony home theatre. It was very nice arrangement, I will also do the same arrangement if possible.<p>

Then we went to some jewelry shops and then went to PC-NET to exchange the optic cable. when we went there and told him that the wire was not working he inistantly changed the wire and gave it to us without hesitation. We took it and came out it was that simmple. In India it doesnt happen this way. <p>

Then we went to buy CDs. Here people selling pirated cds stand on the road and keep saying "CDS CDS CDS", like black ticket sellig people, coz piracy is crime na. Then the man took us to a DARK building and opened a door where many and many Cds were  kept on the floor and we had to choose anything for 5 riyals / cd. acyually the price of per cd is 10 riyals but coz we r regular customer of that person he was ready to give us for 5 riyal / cd. We saw "Prince of Persia Sands of time" and "unreal tournament 2k4" (6 cds) and talked for 35 riyals and he said ok for next time coz he was out of stock for unreal tournament.<p>

We then left for some more gold shops and then called our car driver to come and pickup. But the cars were busy in some work so we again took taxi and returned home. Ate paratha with rajma for dinner and Then found the replaced optical cable working fine. My brother was very very happy as the cable was working. <p>

We returned home at 10:30 pm and then I slept at 1:00 am as usual.

<font size=4>
Today I woke up very very late, at 12:00 pm. Since somedays I was dreaming about the dv4000 cam with flash coz I liked it but it would be better with a flash.<p>

I surfed the net after the lunch today as I got up late today. Then I chatted with Rafiq and then played Prince of persia and found that the game again hangs in the same place so I decided to buy the PC game of "Prince of Persia sands of Time".<p>

Just after playing I and my bro went to PC-Net and bought the games we wanted (Unreal Tournament 2k4 and POPSAT ) . Then we looked for one special cable to connect Laptop output to TV but the man said it was 35 riyals (= 400 rs for just a cable) so we left and looked for it in more shops but everyone pointed only at that shop when they didnt have it.<p>

We then bought a Mic and then in one shop Surpisingly i found my dream digicam ( DV4000 with Flash = <a href="http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/DV5000_ELEC.htm#">DV5000</a>) . and it was 750 riyals. Also there was DV3032 and many other models. If only we would have found these products earlier we would have bought those two definitely.<p>

Then our work was over at around 5:30 pm but the car was busy and it was prayer time so we had no option but to just stand outside. We were made to wait till 6:30 pm to reach home. Then after returning home we saw TV till 10 pm and then slept.
