<tr>
<td>This is meant for a healthy competition between the various groups and colleges participating in the fest. This is an event, which will demand higher dimensionality and practicality besides your usual logical thinking and reasoning. This is aimed at the practical know- how's rather than the usual textbook stuff. Be a part of it and we assure you higher knowledge than you can ever find in any technical quiz. </td>

<td>This is not so easy as chess. This will be a crossword of technical terms ,solving which you will be given an attractive prize. This is not going to be easy. Please don't take it to be a minor event among others as we are sure it will take a complete day to solve it. This is to keep you engaged the whole day if you don't find anything to do.<p>
              These crosswords will be given to you as soon as you enter the auditorium by our facilitation team and it needs to be submitted before 4 pm for the results to be declared by the end of the day.</td>

<th bgcolor="#12af78"><font color=black>UPKARAN <br>(MINI PROJECTS COMPETITION)</font></th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>This event encourages all the statewide techs to present their ideas in form of attractive posters. This helps them to get their idea through to the thousands of people across the state and the country. This basically deals with ideas more than the logic behind its implementation. This could be your unanswerable science fiction or your thought of future India or any other thought, which couldn’t be put on the paper. This gives rise to the creative talent hidden in you. And hence it is called the Prathima…your creative image.</td>

<td>Upkaran is the competition of the presentation of mini projects. This basically tests your practical skills in building an upkaran…the basic job of an engineer. This is an event, which will attract masses on true virtue of its quality. Our association stresses on such mini projects and we also held a mini projects exhibition in our college. Get ready for stiff competition from our college guys.</td>

<tr>
<td>This is an event for the recreation of the techs in between the other events to keep them interested in the proceedings. Don't think that this won't be a rewarding one. Mind you, we have a real treasure for you to hunt for. Try your luck and doggy noses to grab some really cool treasures</td>


<td>This is the most important ingredient of this dish. This is the event, which will enlighten and impart the true technical knowledge to all the participants. This will be the most rewarding part of the fest than the valedictory ceremony ,as this is the event which will give you knowledge par prizes. This is the event that fulfills our motto. GYAAN………get it. 

                     <p>The seminar will be conducted by the giants of the information technology on various topics from DSP to EMBEDDED SYSTEMS to DOT NET. This is being done to give the fest a real look of a technical symposium. This is such an important event because it is only this that every person who attends the fest would take home along with the remembrances of our fest.</td>
