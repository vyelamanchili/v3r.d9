== Changelog ==

= 6.4.3 =

Theme updated 08/19/17

* Updated theme to latest version of Foundation, 6.4.3 - Nothing to really worry about. Mostly updates for scss. Just keeping up with the versioning. Here is a list of what Zurb changed in this version https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/releases/tag/v6.4.3
* Corrected the css for related products that were on sale. The sale banner was appearing off center.
* Also corrected the date of the last update in the changelog.txt file.

= 6.4.2 =

Theme updated 08/16/17

* Updated theme to Foundation 6.4.2 - Here is a list of what Zurb changed in this version https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/releases/tag/v6.4.2
* Removed the `wpforge_footer_sidebar_class` function from `functions.php` - before, this function was used to calculate the number of widgets added in the footer sidebar area, and then it would apply the necessary classes to make sure the widget areas appeared properly. With the 6.4 update, this is done automatically so the function is not needed any longer.
* Rewrote the `wpforge_widgets_init` function in functions.php - its smaller now, means less bloat.
* Switched some of the html where rows and columns were still being used.
* Adjusted the comments area.
* Adjusted the `margin-bottom` of pagination.
* Added support for WooCommerce. This should correct any layout issues when using the plugin, as well as prevent the end user from having to add it themselves.
* Adjusted the `.dropdown.menu .is-active > a` color in css as well as the customizer.
* Reworked the header image portion of `header.php` - if an image is displayed then display the div along with the image. If no image is displayed, do not show the empty div.
* Changed the priority of all the WP-Forge css scripts and files.

= 6.4.1.1 =

Theme updated 07/12/17

* Corrected issue with footer sidebar area. Switched to `large auto cells` for each sidebar area. This moves towards the new XY grid from foundation. The calculation in `functions.php` is no longer needed to calculate and add the apropriate sizes to the individual sidebars.
* Added a image size for the custom logo. Logo is set to 1170px wide which is the full length of the theme and the image has auto height. If your image is smaller than the logo area it will shrink accordingly.
* Added back the custom header feature that the custom logo was supposed to replace, so now users can use either the custom logo or custom header feature, as well as random header images.

= 6.4.1 =

Theme updated 07/06/17

* Updated to the latest version of Foundation for Sites v6.4.3 - not really needed but I like to stay on top of things.
* Corrected the `no-js` in styles.css. There was an issue where the menu was loading after the js was loaded and this caused the menu to kind of flash or delay when it finally loaded. This was bugging me that it was happening. Seems to have gotten corrected. See this issue https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/issues/10339
* Removed the Russian.mo file as it is not needed.

= 6.4 =

Theme updated 06/30/17

* Updated to the latest version of Foundation for Sites v6.4.
* Switched the "felx-video" to "Responsive Embed" - This makes sure embedded content, like videos, maintain their aspect ratio as the width of the screen changes.
* Removed the `margin` from responsive embed (flex video), this was causing the bottom portion of embedded videos to be cut off.
* Added selective refresh to the site-title and site-description.
* Added the ability to show or hide the site title and the site description individually.
* Site-title and site-description are now wrapped in a `p` tag when not on the front page. 
* Post titles are wrapped in a H2 tag, except when viewing the actual post, then the post title is wrapped in a H1 tag
* Switched from custom header to custom logo introduced in 4.5
* Added the new Accordion Menu to Off-Canvas and Top-Bar
* Added Schema markup to posts and pages.
* Moved Skip to Content link out of `content-navigation.php` to right after the opening `body` tag.
* Corrected some issues with the customizer css. When some options were changed, those options were not reflecting in the in-line css or preview.
* Added Russian translation files - Thanks to Spartak Klain, https://sajtprint.ru, for taking the time to do this.

= 6.3.1.2 =

Theme updated 04/07/17

* Adjusted some of the inline css of the customizer.
* Corrected an issue where the customizer section pertaining to the footer was not working properly. See this thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/footer-length-not-setting/
* Added customizer option to change the color of text in pages. See this thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/customizer-seems-broken/
* Went through every setting in customizer. Corrected issues with the customizer where options were not working properly. Everything should be working properly now.
* Added 'Default' values to description of all the customizer options. The only options that do not have a default are the default customizer options.
* Added new css for pricing tables. Code is smaller. See http://zurb.com/building-blocks/pricing-table-foundation-6
* Added new css for hollow buttons. Default is that the hollow styles only work for '<button>' elements, which appear to only work in forms.  I added css to cover regular buttons(which are clickable and have links) that have the 'hollow' class added, in effect making what are referred to as 'ghost buttons'. See https://www.sitepoint.com/rise-ghost-button/
* Added customizer option where user can change the hover background color of the active item in off-canvas menu.
* Added customizer option where user can change the hover background color of the active item in top-bar menu.
* Removed the genericon from both top-bar and off-canvas menus. Switched to the default 'menu-icon'.
* Divided 'customizer.css' into sections.
* Removed the color option for 'Nav Content Background Color' - this option is not relevant as the end user cannot see the nav content area. If you can't see it then there is no reason it should be there. I set the background color for '.nav_wrap' to transparent in 'style.css'

= 6.3.1.1 =

Theme updated 03/16/17

* Moved all css related to customizer options into `customizer.css`.
* Reconfigured the inline css of the customizer. The only time an inline style will appear is when a change is made via the customizer and only the css for the elelment that was changed will be displayed inline.
* Corrected an issue where the links in top-bar were not displaying to the right if `links to the right` was selected for `Top of Browser - Scroll` and `Top of Browser - Fixed`. See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-off-canvas-behaviour-after-update/#post-8910039
* Removed the second `top-bar-left` div that held the `top-bar-title` from the `top-bar` and replaced with actual `top-bar-title` div. See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-off-canvas-behaviour-after-update/#post-8910039
* Removed `Welcome to` from `theme-dashboard.php` - This is a little redundant as the user knows the name of the theme they have chosen to use.
* Changed the name of the first tab in the `theme-dashboard.php` file to `Getting Started` - I believe this provides a better description of this area as the name of the theme is displayed clearly above.

= 6.3.1 =

Theme updated 03/04/17

* Updated to the latest version of Foundation 6.3.1 - Please look here https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/releases for a list of changes.

= 6.3.0.2 =

Theme updated 03/02/17

* Switched code in `content-off_canvas.php` on line 59 from `wpforge_topbar_mobile_display` to `wpforge_mobile_display` - this was causing the off-canvas menu not to appear when "Use Off-Canvas for Mobile?" was set to yes.
* Adjusted the priority of the `Off-Canvas Settings`.

= 6.3.0.1 =

Theme updated 02/27/17

* Corrected an issue in the 'theme-dashboard.php' file. Seems I added the version code in the wrong area.

= 6.3.0 =

Theme updated 02/27/17

* Updated to Foundation version 6.3.
* Updated Font-Awesome to 4.7
* Removed ap.js - moved the actual call for foundation to theme-functions.js - now there is only one file.
* Added 'what-input.js' and 'foundation.js' to the 'wpforge_theme_functions' of functions.php - this makes the scripts load closer to the closing body tag as they were meant to be.
* Moved to one off-canvas file for the theme. There is no need to have two of the same files being called by two different fuinctions, when one file and one function will do.
* Moved Use Off-Canvas for Mobile? to Top-Bar Settings section.
* Added options for off-canvas that will appear when Use Off-Canvas for Mobile? is set to 'Yes' in Top-Bar Settings. These settings only affect mobile Off-Canvas (the off-canvas menu used in conjunction with the top-bar)
* Switched 'data-accordion' to 'data-drilldown' in off-canvas. 'data-accordion' still does not work as of 6.3.0 and is slated to be possibly added to next major release, 6.4. See this thread https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/9348 - For now 'data-drilldown' will remain in place until the 'data-accordion' is corrected and functions properly. Thanks to @cbirdsong for asking how this is done, which promted the switch: See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/parent-links-of-off-canvas-mobile-menu-not-working/
* Updated 'off-canvas' menu to the latest version. Unfortunately, only two Off-Canvas Directions are available: 'position-left' and 'position-right'. The other positions, 'position-top' and 'position-bottom', are slated for possible inclusion in the next update, keep in mind I make no guarantee that they will. The reason they were not added in this update is due to the fact that currently the menu does not look proper if top or bottom is used.
* Added the abilty for the user to set the Off-Canvas Transitions to 'push' or 'overlap'.
* Removed Foundation 'active' class from menus. Switched to'current-menu-item', which is already built into WP core. In my opinion this is a much better option and is easier to style. Thanks @OttoPotto for bringing up this request which gave me the idea to switch. See this thread https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/50
* Removed the title-bar title link from top-bar and off-canvas menus. In my opinion, I feel this is redundant as normally users add a link to the home page in the menu.
* Switched to 'data-sticky-container' and 'data-sticky' in place of 'fixed' for the main menu when the Top-Bar is set to Top of Browser - Fixed.
* Moved 'Use Off-Canvas for Mobile?' section into the Top-Bar Settings section after moving towards one off-canvas file. Makes more sense this option should only be available if the top-bar is selected as the primary menu.
* Modified the js code in contain-to-grid.js, which was eventually moved it to theme-functions.js. See this thread https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/51 Thanks to @HenkBarreveld.
* By modifying and moving the 'contain-to-grid' js this allowed for the removal of the 'wpforge_contain_to_grid' function from functions.php as well as removal of the actual 'contain-to-grid.js' file, as it was no longer needed.
* Corrected a few issues with all of the different navigation menus regarding colors. Specific issues were how the 'current-menu-item' appeared for the top-bar and off-canvas menus. Typically what would happen is, if the colors for the active or 'current-menu-item' were selected for the top-bar, those color choices were applied to 'off-canvas' as well. What if the user wanted different colors for the 'current-menu-item' in 'off-canvas'? So I added 'current-menu-item' color choices to Off-Canvas Colors section.
* Wrapped Recent Posts, Popular Categories, Monthly Archives and Popular Tags elements of 404.php in <ul>.
* Removed references to earlier versions of the theme from CHANGELOG.txt. These references referred to an earlier version of WP-Forge which was built using Foundation 5.
* Removed the old admin notice. Replaced with a new theme info page located under Appearance called 'WP-Forge Theme'.

= 6.2.4.2 =

 Theme updated 10/31/16

* Wrapped 'wpforge_setup' function in a 'if_function_exists'. This function is located in functions.php.
* Modified the padding of the next and previous buttons in orbit.
* Corrected an issue where the sub menu items could not be clicked on touch screens. Thanks to @gsatsan for bringing it to my attention: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/touch-menu-not-working/#post-8376221
* Updated the .po file

= 6.2.4.1 =

Theme updated 10/27/16

= 6.2.4 =

Theme updated 10/23/16

* Updated Foundation to latest version, 6.2.4
* Corrected issue with 'active' class css in menu widget. The background was filled the active color.
* Added '!important' to line 4353 of customizer.php - this portion of the file deals whith the hover color of the active link in the sidebar menu widget. Before adding '!important', when hovering over an active link in the menu widget, the link would disappear.
* Added Pricing Table css from Foundation 5.
* Modified contain-to-grid.js - Thanks to @HenkBarreveld for the suggestion - see this thread: https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/49
* Added css that affects the look and feel of the Orbit bullets. They appear smaller now. You can easily adjust the css to suit your needs. CSS is located on line 1013 of style.css
* Added flex-video class to videos shared from VideoPress.com.
* Corrected issue with the arrow not showing in select boxes.
* Added a "scroll to" function to 'theme-functions.js' this will allow you to add anchor points to content in your theme and associate links with those anchors. When the link is clicked, the theme will scroll to the anchor point.

= 6.2.3.1 =

Theme updated 06/26/16

* Changed the 'wp_get_attachment_metadata()' function for images in image.php - Seems there was an error being generated about the width and the height. Looked at the snippet in Twenty Sixteen and adjusted the function in WP-Forge.

* Removed sitemap style sheet from css folder as it was not needed.
* Removed the post thumbnail from sitemap.php.
* Added '!important' to line 4369 of customizer.php - this portion of the file deals whith the hover color of the active link in the footer. Before adding '!important', when hovering over an active link in the footer, the link would disappear.

= 6.2.1.1 =

Theme updated 04/17/16

= 6.2 =

Theme updated 03/27/16

* Updated to the latest version of Zurb's Foundation, 6.2
* Increased the width of the theme from 1024px to 1200px. This is based off the new width of rows which is 1200px.
* With the increase in width, I decided to add a fourth footer widget.
* Added fonts.css to editor. Previously only genericons.css was added. Since this was combined into fonts.css with font-awesome, fonts.css was added. Now genericons and font-awesome are available via the editor.

* Removed the 'wpforge_active_list_pages_class' function. This started on line 276 of functions.php - This function was not need as the 'wpforge_active_nav_class' function above it starting on line 261 added the same 'active' class to the current page item in the top-bar menu.

* Removed the custom-bckground-white body class from the theme. I saw no purpose in it, so it is removed.

These labels appear properly now. See this thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/comment-form-labels-not-visible-on-discussion-setting-change?replies=3#post-7869547 - Thanks to user "forbc" for bringing this to my attention.
* Added option in customizer to reset the comment forms back to their original positions. For details see http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-comment-text-field-to-bottom-in-wordpress-4-4/
* The separator for breadcrumbs will now show automatically via css.
* Added function to wpforge-functions.js that removes empty p and br tags from the content area.
